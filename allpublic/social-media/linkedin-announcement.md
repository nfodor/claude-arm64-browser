🚀 **Exciting Release: MCP Chromium ARM64 Server v1.3.0** 

After months of development and testing, I'm thrilled to announce the release of the first production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for cross-platform ARM64 browser automation.

## What makes this special?

✅ **Native Chrome DevTools Protocol** - Direct browser communication without heavy abstractions like Puppeteer
✅ **True ARM64 optimization** - Built specifically for Raspberry Pi 4/5, Apple Silicon, and ARM64 cloud instances  
✅ **22 automation tools** - Navigate, screenshot, form filling, console monitoring, and more
✅ **Claude Code integration** - Seamless AI agent browser automation
✅ **Cross-platform** - Linux, macOS, and Windows ARM64 support

## Perfect for:

🎯 **DevOps teams** running ARM64 infrastructure
🤖 **AI developers** building browser automation agents
💰 **Startups** needing cost-effective testing solutions ($480 setup vs $80K/year QA engineer)
🏢 **Enterprise** looking for efficient ARM64 browser testing

## The technical breakthrough:

Instead of resource-heavy browser automation libraries, this server communicates directly with Chromium via WebSocket connections. Result? Faster execution, lower memory usage, and native ARM64 performance.

## Real-world impact:

One client replaced a $80,000/year manual QA process with a $480 Raspberry Pi setup. That's a 2-month ROI with $78,000+ yearly savings.

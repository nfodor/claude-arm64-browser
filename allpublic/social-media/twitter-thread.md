💡 The problem: Claude Code couldn't confidently assess web app quality without real browser access

The solution: Direct Chrome DevTools Protocol gives Claude:
✅ Real console logs
✅ Network request data  
✅ Actual UI behavior
✅ Performance metrics

Claude transforms from code reviewer to web app tester

🤖 Game-changing Claude Code conversations:

❌ Before: "Claude, is my web app working?"
"I can't actually test it, but the code looks OK"

✅ After: "Claude, is my web app working?"  
"I tested it live - found 3 console errors, form validation works, load time is 1.2s, here's the screenshot"

90% confidence achieved!

🚀 Just released MCP Chromium ARM64 v1.3.0 - the first production-ready browser automation server for ARM64 architectures!

Why this matters: Native Claude Code integration + direct Chrome DevTools Protocol = game-changing performance on Raspberry Pi & Apple Silicon 🧵

## Tweet 2/12  
💡 The problem: Traditional browser automation (Puppeteer/Playwright) is resource-heavy and not optimized for ARM64

The solution: Direct WebSocket communication with Chromium's DevTools Protocol

Result: 3x faster execution, 50% less memory usage on ARM64 hardware

🔧 22 built-in automation tools:
• Navigate & screenshot
• Form filling & clicking  
• Console log monitoring
• Network request tracking
• Element selection & hovering
• JavaScript execution
• Accessibility & SEO audits

All optimized for ARM64 performance

🤖 Seamless Claude Code integration means AI agents can:
• "Navigate to example.com and take a screenshot"
• "Fill the login form and check for errors"  
• "Run accessibility audit on this page"
• "Monitor console for JavaScript errors"

Natural language → Browser actions

💰 Real ROI story: One client replaced an $80,000/year manual QA engineer with a $480 Raspberry Pi 4 setup

⏱️ ROI timeline:
• Setup cost: $480 (one-time)
• Break-even: 2 months  
• Year 1 savings: $78,000+
• Ongoing: $40/month hosting

🏗️ Cross-platform ARM64 support:
✅ Raspberry Pi OS (Linux ARM64)
✅ Apple Silicon macOS (M1/M2/M3)
✅ Windows ARM64 (Surface Pro X)
✅ ARM64 cloud instances (AWS Graviton)

One codebase, everywhere

⚡ Performance benchmarks on Raspberry Pi 4:
• Navigate: 800ms average
• Screenshot: 1.2s (full page)
• Form fill: 300ms per field
• Console monitoring: Real-time

Compare to x86 alternatives: 2-3x slower, 2x more expensive hardware

## Video Description:

**üöÄ I replaced an $80,000/year QA engineer with a $480 Raspberry Pi setup - here's how!**

In this video, I'll show you how I built the first production-ready browser automation server for ARM64 architectures, featuring:

‚úÖ Direct Chrome DevTools Protocol communication (no Puppeteer overhead!)
‚úÖ Native ARM64 optimization for Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Apple Silicon  
‚úÖ 22 built-in automation tools
‚úÖ Seamless Claude Code AI integration
‚úÖ Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows ARM64)

**üéØ TIMESTAMPS:**
00:00 - The Problem: Traditional Browser Automation Sucks on ARM64
02:15 - Solution: Direct Chrome DevTools Protocol 
04:30 - Live Demo: Setting up on Raspberry Pi 4
07:45 - Performance Comparison: This vs Puppeteer
10:20 - Claude Code Integration Demo
13:15 - Real ROI Calculation: $480 vs $80K
15:30 - Advanced Use Cases & Deployment
18:45 - Technical Deep Dive: How It Works
22:10 - Getting Started Guide

**üí∞ REAL ROI BREAKDOWN:**
- Manual QA Engineer: $80,000/year
- This Pi 4 Setup: $480 one-time + $40/month hosting
- Break-even time: 2 months
- Year 1 savings: $78,000+

**üîß WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:**
- Why traditional browser automation fails on ARM64
- How Chrome DevTools Protocol works under the hood
- Setting up production-ready automation on Raspberry Pi
- Integrating AI agents for natural language browser control
- Scaling to multiple Pi instances for enterprise testing
- Cost optimization strategies for SaaS startups

**üìä PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS SHOWN:**
- Navigate: 800ms (vs 2.4s Puppeteer)
- Screenshot: 1.2s full page
- Memory usage: 80MB (vs 160MB+ Puppeteer)
- Form interaction: 300ms per field

- AI developers building browser automation agents
- Students learning web development and testing
- Anyone tired of Puppeteer's ARM64 performance

**üì± TESTED PLATFORMS:**
‚úÖ Raspberry Pi 4/5 (Raspberry Pi OS)
‚úÖ Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)
‚úÖ Windows ARM64 (Surface Pro X)
‚úÖ AWS Graviton instances
‚úÖ Oracle Cloud ARM64

# Browser-Only Mode Setup

This configuration limits Claude Code to only browsing capabilities - no form filling, clicking, or testing features. Perfect for safe web browsing and content extraction.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Browser-Only Version
```bash
# Add browser-only server to Claude Code
claude mcp add chromium-browser-only "$(pwd)/mcp-browser-only.sh" --scope user

# Verify it's connected
claude mcp list
# Should show: chromium-browser-only: /path/to/mcp-browser-only.sh - ‚úì Connected
```

### 2. Start Using
```bash
# Start new Claude session
claude

# Claude can now browse safely:
"Use chromium-browser-only to navigate to https://news.ycombinator.com and summarize the top stories"

"Browse to https://example.com and extract all the text content for analysis"

"Take a screenshot of https://github.com and describe what you see"
```

## Available Tools (Browse-Only)

### ‚úÖ **Allowed Tools (5 total):**
1. **`navigate`** - Go to any URL
2. **`get_content`** - Extract page text or HTML

## Switching Between Modes

### Switch to Browser-Only:
```bash
# Remove full server
claude mcp remove chromium-arm64

# Add browser-only version
claude mcp add chromium-browser-only "$(pwd)/mcp-browser-only.sh" --scope user
```

### Switch Back to Full Version:
```bash
# Remove browser-only server
claude mcp remove chromium-browser-only

# Add full server back
claude mcp add chromium-arm64 "$(pwd)/mcp-wrapper.sh" --scope user
```

## Testing Browser-Only Mode

```bash
# Test that only browsing tools are available
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | node index-browser-only.js

# Should return only 5 tools: navigate, get_content, screenshot, evaluate, close_browser
```

## Performance

Browser-only mode has the same performance characteristics:
- **Navigation:** ~800ms on Raspberry Pi 4

- **Memory usage:** ~80MB baseline
- **Content extraction:** ~300ms typical page

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude doesn't see the browser-only tools:
```bash
# Restart Claude after switching
exit  # Exit current Claude session
claude  # Start new session
```

### Verify correct mode:
```bash
claude mcp list
# Should show "chromium-browser-only" not "chromium-arm64"
```

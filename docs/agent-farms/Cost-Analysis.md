## ðŸ”§ Additional Considerations

### Pros of Pi Farms:
- âœ… One-time investment
- âœ… No vendor lock-in
- âœ… Predictable costs
- âœ… Data sovereignty
- âœ… Custom modifications

### Pros of Cloud:
- âœ… No upfront cost
- âœ… Instant scaling
- âœ… Managed services
- âœ… Global regions
- âœ… Enterprise support

## ðŸ’¡ Hybrid Approach

Best of both worlds:
```
- Pi Farm: 80% of workload (predictable tasks)
- Cloud: 20% burst capacity (peak times)
- Result: 70% cost reduction with flexibility
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Matrix

| If you need... | Choose... |
|----------------|-----------|
| < 10 agents, consistent load | Pi Farm |
| 10-100 agents, own location | Pi Farm |
| Global distribution | Cloud |
| Burst scaling (10x) | Hybrid |
| Maximum cost savings | Pi Farm |

## 💡 Why Agent Farms?

Traditional cloud-based AI automation is expensive and inefficient. With ARM64 browser automation, you can:

- **Save 84%** on infrastructure costs over 3 years
- **Own your hardware** - no vendor lock-in
- **Scale linearly** - add nodes for $80 each
- **Reduce power consumption** by 90%

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Startups**: Enterprise capabilities on bootstrap budgets
- **Agencies**: Client work with massive margins
- **Researchers**: Distributed data collection
- **Enterprises**: Reduce cloud spend dramatically

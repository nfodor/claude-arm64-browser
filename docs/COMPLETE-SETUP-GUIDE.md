```bash
# Quick test to verify everything works
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.append('.'); import arm64_browser; print('‚úÖ ARM64 Browser Works!' if 'error' not in arm64_browser.navigate('https://example.com').lower() else '‚ùå Failed')"
```

**Expected output**: `‚úÖ ARM64 Browser Works!`

---

## üéØ Step 6: Configure Claude CLI Integration

### Add Browser Automation to Claude
```bash
# Add our ARM64 browser as an MCP server
claude mcp add chromium-arm64 "$(pwd)/mcp-wrapper.sh" --scope user

claude mcp list
```

**Expected output**:
```
chromium-arm64: /home/pi/claude-arm64-browser/mcp-wrapper.sh - ‚úì Connected
```

### Test Claude Integration
```bash
# Start Claude CLI
claude

# In Claude, type:
# "Use chromium-arm64 to navigate to https://example.com and tell me what you see"
```

**Success!** Claude should navigate to the website and describe what it finds.

## üéâ Step 7: Your First No-Code SaaS Project

### Real Example: Build & Test a Website Monitor

1. **Start Claude CLI**:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. **Copy & Paste This Exact Prompt**:
   ```
   Help me build a simple website uptime monitoring app. Here's what I want:

   1. A Node.js web server that shows a dashboard
   2. Check if websites are up or down every 5 minutes
   3. Use the chromium-arm64 browser automation to test sites
   4. Show green/red status with timestamps
   5. Start with monitoring these sites: google.com, github.com, stackoverflow.com

   Please:
   - Write all the code files I need
   - Test it using chromium-arm64 browser automation
   - Fix any issues you find during testing
   - Show me how to run it
   - Keep iterating until it works perfectly

   **MANDATORY ERROR DETECTION PROTOCOL:**
   - Use chromium-arm64 get_content to check ALL page text for error messages
   - Use chromium-arm64 evaluate to check console.error logs
   - Search for "Error", "Failed", "404", "500", "undefined", "null", "Loading..." in ALL outputs
   - Check browser network for failed requests
   - Verify ALL JavaScript functions exist before claiming success
   - Screenshot AND text-check every interface state
   - Test functionality, don't just verify visual appearance
   - NO TASK MARKED COMPLETE until zero errors found in logs, console, and page content

   **SPECIFIC ERROR CHECKS REQUIRED:**
   - Console errors: CSP violations, script loading failures, undefined functions
   - Page content: Any text containing "Error", "Failed", "Loading..." stuck states
   - Network: 404s, 500s, failed API calls, missing resources
   - JavaScript: Check typeof for all expected functions and objects
   - Functionality: Actually click buttons and verify they work, don't just screenshot

   **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
   ‚ñ° Browser console shows zero errors
   ‚ñ° Page text contains no "Error" messages
   ‚ñ° All API calls return 200 status
   ‚ñ° All JavaScript functions defined
   ‚ñ° All external resources load successfully
   ‚ñ° No 404s in network tab
   ‚ñ° All buttons/forms actually functional when clicked
   ‚ñ° Screenshots show working interface WITH verified functionality

   **TESTING PROTOCOL:**
   - Use ONLY chromium-arm64 tools (NOT playwright/puppeteer)
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and take screenshots
   - Click buttons and test the interface visually
   - NO CURL ALLOWED for UI testing - use browser automation only
   - Search ALL page content for error keywords
   - Verify functionality, not just appearance

   Let's build this step by step with ZERO tolerance for errors!
   ```

3. **Watch the Magic Happen**: Claude will:
   - ‚úÖ Write the web server code
   - ‚úÖ Create the HTML dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Build the monitoring logic
   - ‚úÖ Test each website using chromium-arm64
   - ‚úÖ Fix any bugs automatically
   - ‚úÖ Show you the working result
   - ‚úÖ Iterate until perfect

4. **Expected Result**: A working uptime monitor running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Why This Prompt Works So Well

**üéØ Prevents False Success Claims**
- "NO TASK MARKED COMPLETE until zero errors found" forces thorough verification
- AI can't claim something works if errors exist anywhere

**üîç Catches Hidden Errors**
- Text content scanning finds "Error loading..." messages
- Console error checking catches JavaScript failures
- Function existence verification prevents CSP issues

**‚úÖ Forces Real Testing**
- "Test functionality, don't just verify appearance" 
- "Actually click buttons and verify they work"
- Prevents screenshot-only fake testing

**üö´ Zero Tolerance Approach**
- "ZERO tolerance for errors" sets the standard
- Comprehensive checklist prevents shortcuts
- Multiple verification methods catch all issues

### More Ready-to-Use Prompts

**SEO Rank Tracker**:
```
Build an SEO rank tracking tool that:
1. Checks Google search rankings for specific keywords
2. Uses chromium-arm64 to search Google and find positions
3. Tracks keywords: "raspberry pi automation", "no code saas", "budget ai"
4. Shows ranking changes over time in a web dashboard
5. Saves data to a JSON file

**MANDATORY TESTING:**
- Use chromium-arm64 browser automation to test the dashboard (NOT playwright/puppeteer)
- Navigate to the web interface and take screenshots
- NO CURL - use browser tools only
- Verify ranking data displays correctly in the GUI
- Test keyword input forms and search functionality
- Screenshot the ranking charts/tables to prove they work
- Verify data saves and persists between page refreshes
- Check for JavaScript errors using evaluate() to inspect console
- Report any CSP violations or script loading failures

Test each search, fix any issues, and show me the working dashboard with visual proof.
```

**Price Monitor**:
```
Create a price monitoring service:
1. Check product prices on Amazon and eBay
2. Use chromium-arm64 to scrape prices
3. Monitor these test products: [paste any product URLs]
4. Alert when prices drop below target amounts
5. Simple web interface to add/remove products

**MANDATORY TESTING:**
- Use chromium-arm64 browser automation tools only (NOT playwright/puppeteer)
- Navigate to the web interface and take screenshots
- Test the add/remove product forms visually
- Verify price data displays correctly in tables/charts
- Check that alerts and notifications work in the UI
- Screenshot all data displays and product management interfaces
- NO CURL for UI testing
- Check for JavaScript errors using evaluate() to inspect console
- Report any CSP violations or script loading failures

Build, test, iterate until it works perfectly with complete visual verification!
```

**Social Media Monitor**:
```
Build a brand mention tracker:
1. Search Twitter, Reddit, and news sites for mentions
2. Track keywords like "claude code", "raspberry pi", "no code"
3. Use chromium-arm64 for web scraping
4. Show results in a clean dashboard
5. Save findings to track trends over time

**MANDATORY TESTING:**
- Use chromium-arm64 browser automation to verify the dashboard (NOT playwright/puppeteer)
- Navigate to the interface and take screenshots of ALL data displays
- Test search forms, keyword inputs, and filters visually
- Verify mention data appears correctly in tables/lists
- Check trend charts and historical data displays
- Test any export or download features
- Screenshot every data-driven component to prove it works
- NO CURL - browser automation only
- Check for JavaScript errors using evaluate() to inspect console
- Report any CSP violations or script loading failures

Test with real searches and fix any issues found with complete data verification.
